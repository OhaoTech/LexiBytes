Plan for Building a Local LLM-Powered Interactive Word Game(LexiBytes)
Release Platform: Steam
Frontend: C++ (Cross-Platform)
Backend: Ollama (Local LLM Inference)

---

Core Concept & Game Design
Genre: Text-based interactive word game with dynamic storytelling/puzzle-solving.
Unique Value: Offline play using local LLM for infinite, personalized interactions.
Game Modes (Examples):
Mystery Adventure: Solve a story-driven mystery by questioning AI-generated characters.
Word Duels: Compete against the LLM in creative challenges (e.g., poetry, riddles).
Collaborative Storytelling: Co-write a story with the LLM, with branching outcomes.
Win/Loss Conditions:
Progress-based (e.g., solve a mystery in X steps).
Score systems (e.g., creativity ratings for player inputs).

Technical Architecture
#### Frontend (Unity2D)
Framework: Unity 2022.3 LTS or newer
Key Features:
- UI Toolkit/uGUI for chat interface and menus
- TextMeshPro for high-quality text rendering
- DOTween for smooth animations
- Unity Input System for controls
- Addressables for content management

#### Backend (Ollama Integration)
Communication: HTTP requests to localhost:11434 via libcurl or Boost.Beast.
API Workflow:
// Example: Send prompt to Ollama
POST /api/generate
Body: {
  "model": "mistral",
  "prompt": "You're a wizard. Reply to the player: {PLAYER_INPUT}",
  "stream": false
}
Async Handling: Use threads or std::async to prevent UI freezing during LLM inference.

#### Data Flow
Player inputs text → Frontend sends to Ollama.
Ollama generates response → Frontend parses and displays it.
Game state updates based on LLM output (e.g., unlocks new dialogue).

Content & LLM Management
Prompt Engineering:
Prepend context to LLM prompts (e.g., “You are a pirate guarding a treasure. Be cryptic.”).
Use JSON templates for structured responses (e.g., {"clue": "..."}).
Validation:
Filter inappropriate content via Ollama’s Modelfile or a blocklist.
Detect keywords to trigger game events (e.g., “key” → unlock door).

Development Phases
Phase 1: Setup (2 Weeks)
- Set up Unity project with required packages
- Create basic UI layouts with UI Toolkit/uGUI
- Implement Ollama communication layer

Phase 2: Core Gameplay (4 Weeks)
Build a prototype game mode (e.g., mystery solver).
Integrate prompt engineering and response parsing.
Add save/load functionality.

Phase 3: Polish (3 Weeks)
- Add particle effects and animations with DOTween
- Optimize build size and loading times
- Implement save system using PlayerPrefs/JSON

Phase 4: Steam Integration (1 Week)
- Integrate Steamworks.NET
- Set up Steam achievements and cloud saves
- Create build pipeline for Steam

Phase 5: Testing & Release (2 Weeks)
Beta test with focus on LLM coherence and hardware compatibility.
Publish Steam page, trailer, and documentation.

Challenges & Mitigation
LLM Latency:
Offer model options (e.g., TinyLlama for low-end devices).
Add “processing…” animations to manage expectations.
Installation Complexity:
Provide a guided setup for Ollama/model downloads in-game.
Cross-Platform Bugs:
Test on Windows/macOS/Linux early (CI/CD with GitHub Actions).

Post-Launch Roadmap
Updates: New storylines, multiplayer modes, mod support.
Community: Steam Workshop integration for user-generated prompts.
Monetization: Premium DLCs with curated adventures.
